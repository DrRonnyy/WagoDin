These are 3D printed adapters to allow WAGO 221-413 and WAGO 221-415 connectors to be attached to a DIN rail. It is simply a merge of wago_221_mount from https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/legacy_printers/printer_mods/GSL12/wago_221_mount and pcb_din_clip_v2 from the Voron Trident.
